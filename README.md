# xamarin-mvvm-light
Sample project for using MvvmLight in a Xamarin.Forms project

Steps to produce this basic project shell.

1. Open Visual Studio 2017 and create a new project (**File->New->Project**)
2. Use the same name that you'll use for your final cross-platform Xamarin project, so namespaces are the same
3. Save the new project in a temporary location, not the normal folder you use for code projects
4. The type of the project should be the *MvvmLight (iPhone)* that is available from the list of project templates
